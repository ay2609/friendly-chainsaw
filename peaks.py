    Kyle & Nobu

    Defines a local neighborhood and finds the local peaks
    in the spectrogram, which must be larger than the
    specified `amp_min`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_spectrogram : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n_freq, n_time)
        Log-scaled spectrogram. Columns are the periodograms of
        successive segments of a frequency-time spectrum.

    amp_min : float
        Amplitude threshold applied to local maxima

    p_nn : int
        The neighborhood radius used for determining if a spectrogram value
        is a local peak. Specified in spectrogram cells.

    Returns
    -------
    List[Tuple[int, int]]
        Time and frequency index-values of the local peaks in spectrogram.
        Sorted by ascending frequency and then time.

    Notes
    -----
    The local peaks are returned in column-major order for the spectrogram.
    That is, the peaks are ordered by time. That is, we look for nearest
    neighbors of increasing frequencies at the same times, and then move to
    the next time bin.

    # Student Code:

    # center neighborhood indices around center of neighborhood

    # Extract peaks; encoded in terms of time and freq bin indices.
    # dt and df are always the same size for the spectrogram that is produced,
    # so the bin indices consistently map to the same physical units:
    # t_n = n*dt, f_m = m*df (m and n are integer indices)
    # Thus we can codify our peaks with integer bin indices instead of their
    # physical (t, f) coordinates. This makes storage and compression of peak
    # locations much simpler.
